# Todo:
1. Check mean values for chap5ex17.
2. Complete Chapter 7 example 13
    1. Implement ESRF filter
    2. Fix the implementation of the SIR
    3. Fix ETPF 3d residual calculations
    4. Use a FORTRAN subroutine for the implicit solver
3. Check what is wrong with chapter 8 example 5.
4. Chapter 8 example 9: The matrix PP is introduced to make sure that the mean of the generated ensemble spread does not change (sum over all the ensemble members at a given spatial grid point equals zero). Is this true? Think about it.
5. Might want to implement chap8ex13 and chap8ex21 as a challenge.
